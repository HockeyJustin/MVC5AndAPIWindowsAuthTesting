# MVC5AndAPIWindowsAuthTesting
Test of Windows Auth with MVC And API

See [MVC and IIS Setup For Windows Authentication.docx](https://github.com/HockeyJustin/MVC5AndAPIWindowsAuthTesting/blob/master/MVC%20and%20IIS%20Setup%20For%20Windows%20Authentication.docx) for details on how this project is set up and IIS setup (some IIS setup will be required to get this working nicely).

See branch [winauth_with_api_calls](https://github.com/HockeyJustin/MVC5AndAPIWindowsAuthTesting/tree/winauth_with_api_calls) for a version that has Windows Auth and A Test client for calling the API.
